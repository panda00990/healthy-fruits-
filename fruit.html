			<li>Fruits are not only delicious but also fascinating. Did you know that bananas are berries, while
				strawberries are not? Apples float in water because they're

				less dense than water. Pineapples contain bromelain, an enzyme that tenderizes meat. Avocados are
				berries, but not sweet. Watermelons are 92% water. The world's heaviest fruit, the jackfruit, can weigh
				up to 100 pounds! Fruits truly showcase nature's diversity and wonder.</li>
<br> <br>

			<li> Fruits are vital parts of a balanced diet since they provide so many health advantages. They are high
				in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that promote general health. Frequent fruit consumption can
				lower the chance of developing chronic illnesses like heart disease, stroke, and several types of
				cancer. Fruits also include a lot of fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar levels, encourages bowel
				regularity, and facilitates digestion. In addition, fruits' natural sugars offer a rapid energy boost,
				which makes them perfect for pre- or post-workout snacking. Furthermore, a lot of fruits include
				hydrating qualities that raise the body's overall hydration levels.</li> <br> <br>
